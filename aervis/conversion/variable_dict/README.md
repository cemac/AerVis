The variables of vardict are constructed from the
PRESM_A_Summary, teafy A, STASHmaster and ukca_stdname files.

The location of these is extracted from global_config.py.

This can be done by:

- Using the defaults
- Providing a separate config file with the `GC=./location/to/new/global_config.py`
- or individually through the `VDLOC=/location/`  env variable.
